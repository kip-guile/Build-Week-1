Your marketing website must include responsive mobile and desktop screen widths. Please see the "Responsiveness" portion of your rubric for more information on this.

The call to action on the website should be a login button that links the user over to the React application that your Front End Architect is building. 

Your marketing website must be hosted on a hosting platform like "Netlify" or "Github Pages".
