        <section class="about_text">
            <p>It all began in August of 2016. Its almost impossible to believe we started out as a booklclub. Way back then, we were called Book Rage. In 2019, our founder, Alexander, joined Lambda school to learn the delicate art of web development from the masters, and then changed our name (yes, to Better Reads).</p>
            <p>We very often had the problem of picking what the next read for our bookclub would be, even though we all knew what kinds of books we enjoyed reading. This solution was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. More importantly, we had to think creatively and strategically to come up with an algorithm that guarantees you will love the next title you choose to dive into. No gimmicks. <br>
            How we do it?
            </p>
            <p>It is a wee bit complicated. Suffice it to say that we help you do the heavy lifting so that you can focus on what you love to do best. Reading.</p>
