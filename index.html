                    <p>Let's just drop a little Evergreen right here. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that.</p>
